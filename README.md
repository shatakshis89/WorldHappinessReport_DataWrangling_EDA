# WorldHappinessReport_DataWrangling_EDA

This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report** data across multiple years (2015â€“2019). It focuses on showcasing **data wrangling skills with NumPy and Pandas**, supported by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). Each CSV file represents a single year (e.g., `2015.csv`, `2016.csv`, ...). The columns may differ slightly across years, so cleaning and standardization were required.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics**: `.describe()`, `.info()`.
- **Top 10 happiest countries per year**.
- **Year-over-year changes** in global happiness scores.
- **Correlation analysis** between happiness score and socio-economic indicators.
- **Regional trends** in happiness.
